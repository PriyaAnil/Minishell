# Minishell

Mini shell is a command processor, typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions. BASH can also read commands from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports piping and variables as well. The goal of this project is to implement a mini-shell that mimics the BASH shell by using Linux Kernel System calls and IPC mechanisms like signals. It will also handle special keyboard actions (ex: Control C).
